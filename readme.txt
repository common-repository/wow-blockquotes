Easily add Warcraft GM blue post blockquotes with rounded corners to your posts and comments.

== Description ==

Great for guild websites that wish to mimic the World of Warcraft GM posts. Add a Warcraft blue post blockquote to your selected text by easily adding tags and changing font color. Version 1.1 updated image files.
Update: 1.5 -  Bless  made the images transparent so they will work with any color themes now and added css so no more manualy changing font colors. The height of the images has been increased so they will work with longer posts as suggested by Leandro. You can now use [ bluepost ][ /bluepost ] instead of the normal blockquote code, Bless’s idea, this will allow you to keep quoted text already on your site from being captured in the warcraft quotes.

== Original author notes ==

Despite the name BlockQuotes, the rounded corner effect isn’t actually produced with a blockquote tag (what you get when you click the wpbqbttn.png button).  What it actually does is replace all instances of [quote] and [/quote] with several divs to build up the box where the blockquote would normally go.  It will also do the same for blockquote tags although you can turn this off.

There are a couple of things to bear in mind when using this plugin:

If you don’t close your tags properly then it will probably mess up your template but Wordpress will do that everywhere, not just with this plugin.
If you have a floated image that overlaps the blockquote, it will sit over the top of the image rather than wrapping round the overlapped part of the image like a proper blockquote.
Nested blockquotes look crap with this plugin.  Why would you want to use nested blockquotes though, they look crap!
If you add any parameters (such as style or cite) to your blockquote tag, it won’t convert your blockquote.

Anyway, give it a whirl and see what you think.  Download the plugin, unzip the contents, copy the blockquotes.php file to /wp-content/plugins and then activate it.  Simple as that, no initial customisation required as the plugin looks here for the images unless you tell it to look elsewhere.  The default images are in the zip file with the plugin if you want to host them yourself or use them as a template to base your own images on.
